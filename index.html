            <h3>Q&A</h3>

            <h4>1. Tell me about yourself</h4>
            <p>My name is Taylor and I recently turned 24. I am currently residing in Portland, but have moved around since I was 7 years old. From that I developed a deep love of traveling. I have had the pleasure of traveling to about 9 different countries and living In England for almost 4 years. There, I was doing what was meant to be one gap year, in between college,  but it quickly turned into more. In England I worked in and out of schools with youth, by coordinating events and launching new programs for them to achieve their goals. I also taught different courses and planned after school programs and lunch clubs. During and before England. I had my own photography/media company. I took engagement, wedding, senior, etc. photos and did graphic design. I started this business when I was only 17 years old, to help fund my move to England and it grew into a passion. </p>
    
            <h4>2. Is there anything you are passionate about?</h4>
            <p>I am passionate about helping young people see their potential by expressing themselves creatively.</p>
    
            <h4>3. Are there any hobbies you enjoy doing?</h4>
            <p>I love traveling, hiking, trying new food, writing poetry, playing music, photography and creating graphics/videos.</p>
    
            <h4>4. Do you go to work and/or school, if yes, what’s the first thing you do after getting home from work and/or school?</h4>
            <p>I work full time and start school this fall full time. The first thing I do when I come home is sleep. I work nights.</p>
    
            <h4>5. What life lessons have you had to learn the hard way?</h4>
            <p>I've had to learn how fleeting life is from the death of my younger cousin. The week before he passed I had to babysit him and was very upset because no one asked me and I wanted to sleep in all summer. I didn't know that would be the last opportunity I would ever have to be with him. This regret turned into a lesson on the importance of cherishing every moment.</p>
            
            <h4>6. If you had only one sense (hearing, touch, sight, etc.), which would you want, and why?</h4>
            <p>It would be a sight! As a visual person it would be hard for me to go through the world sightless. Also since one of my top outlets is photography, it would be very difficult to imagine a world without it.</p>
    
            <h4>7. Can you write in cursive?</h4>
            <p>I am passionate about helping young people see their potential by expressing themselves creatively.</p>
    
            <h4>8. If you could have a super power, what would it be?</h4>
            <p>Yes I can! I actually only write in cursive, it’s hard for me to write in print .</p>
    
            <h4>9. If you could own a mythical creature (unicorn, phoenix, etc.), which one would you pick?</h4>
            <p>A pegasus.</p>
    
            <h4>10. What was your favorite school subject?</h4>
            <p>My favorite subject was english, I love learning how the past has impacted our present and how we can learn from it for our future.</p>
