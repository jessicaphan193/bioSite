        <p>Taylor Marie Barber is a passionate 24 years old who currently resides in Portland. At the age of 7 years old she has developed the love and empathy for traveling due to constant moving. Because of that experience, she has had the pleasure of traveling to at least 9 different countries and being able to live in England for almost 4 years. Even before being able to fly out and see England, Taylor had her own photography/media company. Thanks to this, she was able to help fund her move and grew it into a passion. Within her company, she took engagement, wedding, senior, and many other photos, along with graphic designing, all at the age of 17.</p>
        <p>Outside of what Taylor does on her day-to-day basis, she does have a couple hobbies that she enjoys which includes traveling, hiking, trying new food, writing poetry, playing music, photography and creating graphics/videos. </p>
        <p>Taylor has a passion for helping young people see their potential by expressing themselves creatively. When she was in England, she taught different courses and planned after school programs and lunch clubs. By coordinating events and launching new programs, she worked in and out of schools with youth in order for them to achieve their goals.</p>
        <p>A few fun things to learn about Taylor is, her favorite school subject is English, because she loves learning how the past has impacted our present and how we can learn from it for our future. If Taylor could have any super power, it would be invisibility, if she could be any mythical creature, it would be a pegasus. Taylor can only write in cursive as to it being difficult for her to write in print.</p>
